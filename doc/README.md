Documentation
=============

This directory contains documentation about various components in OpenJ9

* **`compiler`**: Documentation about the compiler technology, codenamed
  Testarossa. 

Much documentation about OpenJ9 is best considered in tandem with the
documentation from [Eclipse OMR](https://github.com/eclipse/omr/tree/master/doc),
as OpenJ9 is built upon the foundational technologies provided by OMR.
