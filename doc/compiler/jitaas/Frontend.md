The frontend, typically instantiated as `TR_J9VM`, is specialized for JITaaS on the server as `TR_J9ServerVM` in the file `VMJ9Server.hpp`. This is done in a manner similarly to how `TR_J9SharedCacheVM` is used for AOT, except the overridden functionality is quite different. For JITaaS, most overridden methods send messages to query information from the `TR_J9VM` on the client. In some cases cached data is accessed instead of performing a remote call. By doing this, we can make the server compile code which is compatible with the client side VM.
